# live-content-import-fix \[[Mediasite Video Platform](http://www.sonicfoundry.com/mediasite/)\]

Update Mediasite Presentation XML files with **IsLive** set to false and **LiveStatus** set to 0 to not to import [Live Content](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff723875(v=expression.40).aspx) altogether with the presentation.

* It does nothing to the original media

## ABOUT

Windows Server 2012 dropped support for [Windows Media Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc239490.aspx)
and [streaming over `MMS://`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/media/windows-media-services/windows-media-server-or-web-server) respectively.
They had switched to [Live Smooth Streaming](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee791818(v=ws.10).aspx).
The Mediasite **Broadcast â€” Windows Media (wmv, wma)** content server can't be set up any more.

*Sonic Foundry suggest a downgrade to Windows Server 2008, but unless you are going to import
Live Content presentations originating from previous Mediasite Server versions you are all good.*

But we were not.

## CODE

**Does not support zipped packages (unzip them first).**
