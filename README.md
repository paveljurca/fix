# Remove Live Content for imported presentations ([Mediasite Video Platform](http://www.sonicfoundry.com/mediasite/))

**What:**

Update Mediasite Presentation XML file with `IsLive` set to **false** and `LiveStatus` **0** to not show up Live Content at import.

* It does nothing to the original media

From here you proceed at import easily. See screenshots below.

_BEFORE_

_AFTER_

**Why:**

Windows Server 2012 drops support for streaming over `MMS://` and Windows Media Server.
Server 2012 had switched to SmoothStreaming built to IIS thus the Mediasite **Broadcast â€” Windows Media (wmv, wma)**
content server cannot be set up.

Sonic Foundry suggest downgrade to Windows Server 2008, but unless you are going to import
a Live Content presentations originating from previous Mediasite Server versions you are good.

But we were not.
