# Remove Live Content for P2G packages

## Mediasite Video Platform

**Issue:**

Windows Server 2012 drops support for streaming over `MMS://` (and basically Windows Media Server; 2012 had switched to SmoothStreaming  built to IIS) thus following **Broadcast â€” Windows Media (wmv, wma)** content server cannot be made running. Sonic Foundry suggest downgrade to Windows Server 2008, but keep on reading..

..This is only a problem if you get to import a Live Content presentation originating from previous Mediasite Server versions.

**Solution:**

Update Mediasite Presentation XML file with `IsLive` set to **false** and `LiveStatus` **0**. (It does nothing to the original media.) From there you proceed at import easily.
